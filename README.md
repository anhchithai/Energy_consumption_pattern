Understanding the patterns of energy consumption will help to distribute, use and save energy effectively. This is essential, especially in this energy crisis time.

About the dataset:
* JERICHO-E (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-00907-w) :The dataset provides the energy consumption of Germany in the whole year of 2019. The dataset is spatially resolved at the NUTS2 level conprising 38 regions and temporally resolved in hours. Calculation separately for (4) application purposes: the residential, industrial, commerce and mobility sectors. Consumption (7) patterns: space heating, hot water, process heat, space cooling, process cooling, mechanical energy, information communication technology, lighting
In total, the dataset includes 28 consumption profiles per NUTS2 region. The Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) is a geocode standard for referencing the subdivisions of Germany for statistical purposes.

* The project also uses data from Open power system data (https://doi.org/10.25832/time_series/2020-10-06) and the statistic data from Eurostat.

This notebook will join these single index dataset and manipulates for some first data analysis on 3 different aspects:

- Temporal and sectoral analysis 
- Sectoral and Spatial analysis 
- Spatial and temporal analysis.
